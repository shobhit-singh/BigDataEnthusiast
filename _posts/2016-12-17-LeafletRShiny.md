Leaflet is one of the most popular open-source JavaScript libraries for interactive maps.

There are many ways to visualize latitude and longitude data on map using R, such as using ggmaps or RgoogleMaps packages. But these packages generate static maps images only. Leaflet allow users to zoom in or zoom out in a very interactive way.

This basic R Shiny App allows you to locate your geographic coordinates on Leaflet interactive map.
